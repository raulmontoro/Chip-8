    virtual machine (VM), provider of the functionality of a physical computer
    developed by Joseph Weisbecker
    
    
    occupies 512 bytes of memory space in these machines
    
    programs start at memory location 512(0x200) and
    do not access any of the memory below location 512 (0x200)
    
    the upper most byte 256 byte (0xF00-0xFFF) are reserved for display refresh, buffer to avoid flickering
    and the 96 bytes below that (0xEA0-0xEff) were reserved for call stack,
    internal use and variables

MODERN CHIP-8 BOARD
    Flash based Interpreter resident within boards Operating System
    32 bit microcontroller 48 MHz
    64x32 pixel monochrome Composite Video Display
    Sound Generator - 30 Tones
    RS485 Serial Port
    Hexadecimal Keypad Interface
    EEPROM Option board - CHIP-8 supported Load and Save Functions.
    Single 5 VDC Supply, using a 2.1x5.5 DC plug
    Small 120x90mm PCA footprint

    37 instructions
    including 3 new instructions to support RS485 Communications
        
    Modern implementations
        interpreter running natively outside the 4K memory space
        no need to avoid the low 512 bytes of memory and it is common to store font date
        in there,
    




    MODES OF OPERATION
        COMMAND MODE
        
            power first applied, start off in command mode
            random data display
            white status bar bottom
                hexadecimal number 4457, normal default value prior to the address being changed
                    show current memory address being pointed to by CHIP-8 program
                    value range from 0000 to FFFF Hex
    
                command mode to use the function keys
                F2 key resets monitor. board red LED will light.
                program data i not lost
    
    
        EDIT MODE
        
            when in edit mode a two digit hexadecimal number is displayed to the right
            of the memoery address. this value represent the data being pointed to by the
            program counter
    
    
    
            F2 key allows the monitor to break out and go back to command mode
            Pressing F1 key followed by the 0 key will place the monitor into edit mode.
            It is this mode that allows a program to be stored in memory.
            Pressing the F1 key when in edit mode will increment the address of the program.
    
            ...
